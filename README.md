## Introduction

Customer churn or attrition is one of the most crucial problems for any business that directly sells or serves customers be it Telecom service providers, eCommerce, insurance and many more. It is important to track and analyse how many customers are leaving the platform and how many are sticking and the reasons behind them. Knowing customer behaviour can greatly enhance decision-making processes and can further help reduce churn to improve profitability.

In this project, we are going to analyse an eCommerce dataset and find the best model to predict customer churn.
